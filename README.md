# Drum-kit
This is drum kit web page, which aims to study how to listen to keyboard keys.

The main point of this web page is for me to start using more advanced javascript and also learn how 
to listen to keyboard events. I also did try using arrow functions in this project in order to get 
more advanced javascript.
